* NixCon 2020 talk

This is @balsoft's talk about Nix flakes, to be presented on NixCon 2020.

** Building

This talk itself is a flake which you can build with

#+BEGIN_SRC
nix build github:serokell/nixcon2020-talk
#+END_SRC

The presentation is =presentation.pdf=, speaker notes are in =speaker-notes.pdf=,
and a compiled HTML article is in =article.html=.

If you wish to play around with this talk, clone it locally and run =nix
develop=; you will be thrown in a shell with all the required dependencies
including fonts. You can then run =make= to build all the artifacts or
=make autoreload= to start automatically rebuilding the presentation. I
have been writing it while having it open in Okular, which automatically
reloads PDF documents when they change.

*** Without flakes

#+BEGIN_SRC
nix-build https://github.com/serokell/nixcon2020-talk/archive/master.tar.gz
#+END_SRC
